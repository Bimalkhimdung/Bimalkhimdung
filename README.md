Hi there, I'm Bimal , a computer engineer with a passion for software development and DevOps. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Python, I love building web applications that are both beautiful and functional.

My experience in DevOps enables me to automate software development processes and improve team collaboration, resulting in faster delivery of high-quality products. I have worked with various tools and technologies such as Ansible,Docker,Docker Swarm, Jenkins and Git and GitHub Action to deploy and manage applications in production environments.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies and frameworks or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and community, and I'm always eager to learn and share my knowledge with others.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
